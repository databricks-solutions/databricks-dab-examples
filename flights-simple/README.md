# flights_simple

The 'flights_simple' project is meant to show a simple project that includes what is needed to demonstrate best practices for developer workflow and CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment). You will find bundle config files `databricks.yml` in the project directory which references bundle resources in the `resources/` directory. GitHub Action to run tests and deploy are found in the `.githubs/workflows` directory.


## Getting started

1. Install the Databricks CLI from https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli.html

2. Authenticate to your Databricks workspace:
    ```
    $ databricks configure
    ```

3. Go to root project directory then deploy a development copy of this project, type:
    ```
    $ databricks bundle deploy --target dev
    ```
    (Note that "dev" is the default target, so the `--target` parameter
    is optional here.)

    This deploys everything that's defined for this project.
    You can find the jobs by opening your workpace and clicking on **Workflows**.

4. Similarly, to deploy a production copy, type:
   ```
   $ databricks bundle deploy --target prod
   ```

5. To run a job or pipeline, use the "run" comand:
   ```
   $ databricks bundle run notebook_validation_job
   ```

6. Optionally, install developer tools such as the Databricks extension for Visual Studio Code from
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/vscode-ext.html. Or read the "getting started" documentation for
   **Databricks Connect** for instructions on running the included Python code from a different IDE.

7. For documentation on the Databricks asset bundles format used
   for this project, and for CI/CD configuration, see
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/index.html.
